## Introduction

All bundles made with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) have the same features, regardless of the bundler that was used.

Except Gulp that will not use Babel to create your final bundle.

## EcmaScript 2015/2016 with Babel

By default, when you declare a JavaScript bundle in your `crafty.config.js` it will be compiled in the simplest possible way.

Let's take this example.

```javascript
{
  js: {
    app: {
      runner: "webpack",
      source: ['js/app.js']
    }
  }
}
```

In this case, this build will run through Webpack and execute the following tasks:

- Linting with ESLint
- Resolve dependencies and create one bundle
- Compile the code using Babel
- Minify all files with Terser

After this, we get a bundle named `app.min.js` in `dist/js`.

Webpack uses Babel to compile modern JavaScript to JavaScript that all browsers understand.

### Babel

Babel is a compiler that gets all its features through plugins.
We chose the best plugins in the community to get the best out of it.

[Our Babel preset](05_Packages/10_babel-preset-swissquote.md) contains everything we need for our web applications.

The options we have for this preset are `environment` and `browsers`.

- `environment` is defined automatically from how you run it (`crafty run/watch/test`).
- `browsers` is defined from `config.browsers`.
  This is a [Browserslist query](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#queries) that you can override.
  We set a default value through [`crafty.config.js`](04_User_Guides/crafty.config.js_Available_Options.md).
